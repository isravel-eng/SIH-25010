## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
### We propose the development of a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized, real-time crop advisory.

### Key features include:

####   A. Soil and Fertilizer Recommendations: Based on soil health data, provide exact fertilizer type, dosage, and timing.

####   B. Weather & Climate Alerts: Location-specific weather forecasting with pest/disease risk alerts.

####   C. Pest/Disease Detection: Farmers can upload leaf/plant images for AI-based disease recognition and receive treatment solutions.

####   D. Market Intelligence: Daily updates on nearest market crop prices to help farmers maximize profits.

####   E. Voice Support: Enabling audio guidance in local languages for farmers with low literacy.

####   F. Feedback & Learning Loop: Collect farmer feedback and improve recommendations using machine learning over time.
## Technical Approach
#### I.Frontend: Mobile application (Android-first, using Flutter for cross-platform).

#### II.Backend: Cloud-based server (Node.js / Django with RESTful APIs).

#### III.Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL for farmer records and advisory logs.

#### IV.Machine Learning Models:
  a.Pest/disease detection using CNN-based image classification.
  b.Weather-based yield prediction using regression models.
  c.Recommendation engine for crop and fertilizer using decision tree models.

#### V.Integration: APIs for weather data, soil testing inputs, and crop market prices.

#### VI.User Interface: Multilingual support with text-to-speech and chatbot interface.

## Feasibility and Viability
#### Feasibility: With access to government databases, weather APIs, and an open-source ML ecosystem, this solution is technically feasible. Farmers are increasingly adopting smartphones, making deployment practical.
#### Challenges: Internet connectivity in rural areas, farmer training, and integration with diverse languages could be problematic.
#### Mitigation: Offline advisory storage, SMS/voice-based extension, and collaboration with agricultural extension officers for training.

## Impact and Benefits
#### Social: Improves knowledge transfer to farmers, bridging digital divides.
#### Economic: Reduces input costs, increases yield, and helps farmers fetch better market prices.
#### Environmental: Prevents overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, ensuring sustainable agriculture.
#### Government & Policy Synergy: Supports “Digital India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” visions, contributing to rural empowerment.
